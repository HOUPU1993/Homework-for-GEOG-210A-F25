Readings, homework assignments, and additional materials will be posted on the class
website. Check the website on a regular basis for updates.
Software: We will running Python on Google colab. You simply need a Google
account (your UCSB account is fine).
Course format: Class will consist partly of lecture (usually Tuesday) and partly of in-
class assignments done in groups (usually Thursday). Section will be devoted to
learning scientific programming skills. Homework assignments will build on the material
covered in class to develop a deeper understanding of core concepts and to enhance
quantitative problem-solving skills. You are encouraged to do the homework
assignments with your group. If you need help, ask your group members or myself. If
you don’t need help, help those that do.
Course goals:
• To refresh, review, and strengthen your mathematical skills
• To strengthen your knowledge of the language and methodologies of quantitative
problem solving
• To further develop your analytical intuition and quantitative problem-solving skills
Teaching goals:
• To guide you through this process in an organized manner
• To challenge you to think rigorously and creatively, and to work collaboratively
• To be approachable and responsive to your learning needs
